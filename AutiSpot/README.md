Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is one of the major mental disorders in terms of neurodevelopment brain functions. The three types of symptoms which Autistic patients exhibit are: social development, difficulty in communication and unusual behavior. Unfortunately, based on the nature of ASD, it is difficult to diagnose. However, applications can be a tremendous help in monitoring,reinforcement and the treatment of patients. This work presents an architectural solution that enables the interoperability between an autistic person and caregivers to contribute on the treatment and monitoring to persons with ASD.
